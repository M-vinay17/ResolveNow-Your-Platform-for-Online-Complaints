# ⚛️ **Getting Started with Create React App**

This project was bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), providing a quick setup to develop powerful React applications.

## 🔧 **Available Scripts**

In the project directory, you can run:

### 🔹 `npm start`

➡️ Runs the app in development mode
➡️ Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser
➡️ Auto-reloads on file changes
➡️ Shows lint errors in the console

---

### 🔹 `npm test`

➡️ Launches the test runner in **interactive watch mode**
➡️ Refer to [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more details

---

### 🔹 `npm run build`

➡️ Builds the app for **production** in the `build` folder
➡️ Minifies code and includes content-based hashes in filenames
➡️ Optimized for best performance and ready to deploy
➡️ Learn more about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment)

### 🔹 `npm run eject`

⚠️ **Warning: One-way operation!**
